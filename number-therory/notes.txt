lcm(a,b)=|a.b|/gcd(a,b)
===================================================
prime factor of 180 is 5 , 3 ,3 , 2 , 2
prime factor of 48 is 3 , 2 , 2 , 2 ,2 

gcd of 180 ,48 is 3 *2* 2= 12

===================================================
======Euclid's algorithm============
given two positive integer a and b such that a>b 
the common divisors of a and b are the same 
as the common divisors of a-b and b
gcd(a,b)==gcd(a-b,b)  as a>b
